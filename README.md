# hubot-ansible-play
This hubot integration is currently in development. It will offer the capability to expose certain playbooks to be run from a chat. There are certain alternative modules available that run ansible playbooks from hubot. However, they offer great flexibility and do not imply any restrictions on the execution of ansible. Basically allowing a user to run arbitrary commands from within the chat. This is an approach to chatops with certain restrictions. We should be able to share certain functionality with a certain usergroup.
